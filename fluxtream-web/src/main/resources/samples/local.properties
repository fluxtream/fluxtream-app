# Set up the database
#   This sample is for the default mysql port 3306.  Modify the xxx's
#   below, and optionally the port, to match your local mysql config.
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/flx?useUnicode=true&connectionCollation=utf8mb4_unicode_ci&characterSetResults=utf8&characterEncoding=utf8&autoReconnect=true

# Set up the datastore locations  
#   The default corresponds to the install pattern in the build instructions for 
#   Linux (https://fluxtream.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FLX/Installation%3A+Linux) and
#   Mac OS X (https://fluxtream.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FLX/Installation%3A+Mac+OS+X)

# This is the location of the datastore executables
btdatastore.exec.location=/home/fluxtream/projects/datastore

# This is the location of the datastore key-value store.  This will grow big, so you might 
# want to consider which drive it should live on.
btdatastore.db.location=/home/fluxtream/projects/db/dev.kvs

# Set up the location of GeoLiteCity.dat databae
#   The default corresponds to the install pattern in the build instructions for Linux and Mac OS X
geoIpDb.location=/home/fluxtream/projects/fluxtream-app/GeoLiteCity.dat

# Optional: set this server up as to act as a mirrored test instance
#   If disableTokenSwap is present and set to any value other than false then 
#   swapping tokens will be disabled on this server instance.  This allows 
#   testing of a clone of a given DB instance without invalidating the 
#   connector instances in the source DB.  Do not set this on master deployment
#   servers
# disableTokenSwap=true

# Set up the root URL of your install
#   The default below is for running locally, if running a web server change to point to your hostname.
homeBaseUrl=http://localhost:8080/

# Set up the root URL for your documentation (optional)
docsHomeBaseUrl=http://yoursubdomain.ngrok.com/

# Set up the environment for these settings
#   The default below is for running locally
environment=local

# To set up a custom welcome page, uncomment the following line and create a corresponding .jsp file in
#   fluxtream-web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp
# homepage.name= xxx

# default location (local only)
defaultLocation.latitude=40.4406
defaultLocation.longitude=-79.9961

# allowed origins for CORS
allowedOrigins=http://fluxtream.dev:3000, http://localhost:3000

# user manuals location (for the developer website): we put it outside of the webapp to allow
# a lifecycle that runs parallel to the app's deployment (this is a temporary solution)
userManuals.location=/foo/bar
